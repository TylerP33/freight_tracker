**UPDATE**

Summary 03/24/2018

- Currently, the Carrier signup/login/logout feature is working as intended.
- Added a load table instead of a "deliveries" table.  I wanted to break down the functionality and I thought deliveries knew too much about itself.


Project To-Do List (urgent)

- add a third table with routing/delivery info
- create logic behind the carrier's load (CRUD)

Project To-Do Wish List (urgent)

- show a pickup/destination on a map from the next table we create (pretty cool)
